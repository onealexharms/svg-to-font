There's a voice in Beetle's head saying it's not a dream. Which, to be honest, does not make it less likely that it is, in fact, a dream. On the other hand, the voice in her head could also point to the other option. Holding on to the idea that it's a dream was the only thing keeping her from freaking out entirely. So let's go with that. That, and deep breaths. Slow, deep breaths.
Beetle found her butt sinking into the edge of a bed. Curls adorned the wood headboard and the duvet was textured linen. Her feet rested on a stone floor. And hard. And there was a candle on the night table. Clearly a dream. She'd been tired. Probably pretty upset by what happened with Sparky. She must have gone up to bed without realizing it.

It's not a dream. Why won't you listen to me?
